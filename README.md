Nearing the end of 2022, Forbes elicited 5 trends that Data Science, as a professional field, will continue into or become mainstream in 2023. Those include data democratization, artificial intelligence (AI), Cloud and Data-as-a-service, real time data (or data streaming), and data regulations. These trends are projected to make data science increasingly influential in the upcoming year, rendering data a powerful and influential factor in the contemporary life.

My opinion on this is that three out of the five elicited trends deal with regulated and accessible data, which is beginning to establish data science as a true science; data science is no longer only of methodology but of epistemology and ethics. The boom of data and data-based technology has made it essential for a more humane and "ergonomic" form of data-related practices.

##AI-Generated art winning a competition evokes controversies

The Colorado State Fair's 2022 State Fair gave its prize to an entrant who drew an AI-generated art. Although it was submitted under the category of "digital art", it still received backlash due to its questionable categorization as "art". The artist defended his work by stating that he "did not break any rules".

Although in this particular case where the artist's work falls into the category of digital art and we fail to reject the hypothesis that his work is art, in broader aspects this displays a potential problem with AI art. Since AI art is based off of existing artwork, usage of these arts to generate art could still be considered as plagiarism and violation of copyright. As I've known, there are digital artists who make a living on patrons paying for their artwork, but AI art may destroy their means of income. There are also cases of blatant plagiarism with AI users who directly plug artists' work into art AI and claim the outcome to be their own work. As far as I've concerned, there should be regulations to constrain these actions in favor of integrity and copyright protection.
